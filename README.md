# Hand Tracking Overlay Project

This project uses Python, MediaPipe, and OpenCV to create a real-time hand tracking overlay similar to the provided reference image. It opens your webcam, tracks your hands and fingers accurately and smoothly, and draws interactive overlays that follow your hand movements.

## Features
- Real-time webcam hand and finger tracking
- Smooth, accurate overlays that do not lose track of fingers
- Custom overlay graphics inspired by the reference image
- Robust and impressive performance

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- MediaPipe
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Setup
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed.
2. All dependencies are installed automatically in the virtual environment.

## Run the Project

```
 C:/Users/admin/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python313/python.exe
```

- Press `Esc` to exit the webcam window.

## Notes
- The overlay is designed for smoothness and accuracy, even with hand movement.
- You can modify the overlay style in `hand_overlay.py` in the `draw_custom_overlay` function.
